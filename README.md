# Crypto Rotors
### By: Vincent Wangworawut and Mohamed Elafifi
Vincent and Mohamed will design and/or implement at least two different variations of enigme rotor machines for their project. Some of the project may reference other projects that were completed during the semester. We may reference outside sources in various places of this project, which will be noted in this README as well as within the code, itself.

# Enigma Rotor
Provide an easy to use Enigma rotor tool with multiple engima rotor machines. 

# Project Goals
The goal of this project is to give users the ability to easily encrypt and decrypt utilizing an Enigma rotor machine. We will create multiple classes and isolate different enigmas. It will also be PIP-able, with the ability to simply pip-install all dependencies on any given users machine. Encrypted and Decrypted plaintext will be output to files for user verification and testing purposes.
